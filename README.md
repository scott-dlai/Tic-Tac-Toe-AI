A program that can always win or draw a 3x3 tic-tac-toe game. This was implemented using the minimax algorithm as well as Alplha-Beta pruning to speed up the process. This User Interface was built using React.js.

# Structure
You can find most of the functions of the algorithms inside `nextMove.js` inside the `src` folder. In addition, I have also created `calculateWinner()` and `isFull()` function. All the React components are inside `index.js` as I followed React.js tutorial on their website at first.

# Hosting
This project is hosted on Netlify. Check the game out at https://scottlai.codes

# Local Installation
This project uses create-react-app, so you'll need to install [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

1. Change your directory into the project folder and type `npm install` in your terminal / command line

2. Run `npm start` and the website is hosted on port 3000 (localhost:3000)

# Credit
I learnt about the minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning technique through YouTube and Wikipedia. I also used React tutorial on their website as boilerplate code. However, I have modified the code as I progressed through the project.
